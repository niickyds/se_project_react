# WTWR (What to Wear?)

This project ties into my backend WTWR (What to Wear?) as its functioning front-end. This displays all the information from the backend while giving users a interactive ui.

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.
